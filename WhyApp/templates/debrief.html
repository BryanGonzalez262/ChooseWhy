                    <p>Judgment and decision-making are important aspects of public and private life. Using surveys like the one you just completed, we are examining the factors that go into making social decisions.</p>
                    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1em;">How is this being tested? </p>
                    <p>We have asked you to respond to stories or videos that differ on several important factors. By isolating different variables that are involved in social thought, we can better understand how we arrive at complex decision-making. For example, some actions are seen as more worthy of blame if they are performed intentionally. Harming someone on purpose is generally worse than harming someone by accident, or even harming someone in a way that is foreseen but not intended.</p>
                    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1em;">Main questions and hypotheses: </p>
                    <p>A fundamental goal of our research is to understand the cognitive and emotional factors that influence social judgment and decision-making. We are studying these factors by presenting people with hypothetical questions that vary in specific ways and seeing which factors make a difference. Some people filled out the same survey that you just filled out. Others got slightly different surveys.</p>
                    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1em;">Why is this important to study?</p>
                    <p>By comparing answers on these important factors, we learn about what factors affect social judgment. This has crucial implications for many public domains, including the legal system.</p>
